  <h1>Something Just Like This</h1>
  <h2>The Chainsmokers ft. Coldplay</h2>
  <p>
    I've been reading books of old <br>
    The legends and the myths <br>
    Achilles and his gold <br>
    Hercules and his gifts <br>
    Spiderman's control <br>
    And Batman with his fists <br>
    And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
  </p>
  <p>
    But she said "Where'd you wanna go? <br>
    How much you wanna risk? <br>
    I'm not looking for somebody <br>
    With some superhuman gifts <br>
    Some superhero <br>
    Some fairytale bliss <br>
    Just something I can turn to <br>
    Somebody I can kiss"
